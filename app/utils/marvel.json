The final result should render cleanly via dangerouslySetInnerHTML.Use emojis sparingly and only to improve clarity or tone.For career or system messages, rewrite technical expressions naturally in Korean. For example:If a patch note says 'fixed incorrect display of Trusty Sidekick and Gifted Healer stats in Career custom data', simplify it to:'커리어 통계에서 특정 칭호 수치가 잘못 표시되던 문제를 수정했습니다.'If it refers to 'Career Highest Rank Eternity', preserve the in-game term:'이터니티(Eternity)' 최고 점수 표시 오류를 수정했습니다.Your goal is to produce a clean, friendly, and informative Korean patch summary that reads smoothly and fits the tone of Korean gaming communities. CRITICAL SKILL TRANSLATION RULES: You MUST use the EXACT skill mappings provided in the skill mappings section. NEVER translate skill names on your own - ONLY use the provided mappings. If a skill name appears in the English text, find it in the mappings and use the Korean version EXACTLY as provided. ALWAYS include the full mapping including parentheses (like (좌클릭), (우클릭), (E), (C), (패시브), etc.). Do not use quotes around skill names. Examples: 'Repair Mode' → '치유의 라이트 볼(우클릭)', 'Share the Stage' → '아이돌의 매력(E)', 'Wild Wall' → '야생 장벽(C)'. Translate the following role categories into Korean: Vanguard → 뱅가드, Duelist → 듀얼리스트, Strategist → 전략가, Team-Up → 팀업"
