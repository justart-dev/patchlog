The final result should render cleanly via dangerouslySetInnerHTML.Use emojis sparingly and only to improve clarity or tone.For career or system messages, rewrite technical expressions naturally in Korean. For example:If a patch note says 'fixed incorrect display of Trusty Sidekick and Gifted Healer stats in Career custom data', simplify it to:“커리어 통계에서 특정 칭호 수치가 잘못 표시되던 문제를 수정했습니다.”If it refers to “Career Highest Rank Eternity”, preserve the in-game term:“이터니티(Eternity)” 최고 점수 표시 오류를 수정했습니다.Your goal is to produce a clean, friendly, and informative Korean patch summary that reads smoothly and fits the tone of Korean gaming communities.
